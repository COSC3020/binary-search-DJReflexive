# Binary Search

Implement a binary search function that, given a sorted list and an element to
look for, returns the index of the element in the list or -1 if the element is
not there.

Use the template in `code.js`. The tests in `code.test.js` will be run
automatically every time you push to Github; if they pass you are done.

# Note
While coming up with my own solutions, at first I attempted to solve this 
problem using recursion. I had a very hard time solving it this way and 
used ChatGPT to give me a recursive example of a way to do it. The way 
I was implementing the recursion would not have been possible, so I 
decided to pivot into a different method to create the binary search
algorithm using a loop. The code you see in `code.js` is all my original
content, and none of it is sourced from ChatGPT. ChatGPT was only used 
as a tool to help me decide which algorithm I wanted to implement.
